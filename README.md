AMPER: Autonomous Manipulator for Plugging and EV Recharging

This repo encapsulates hardware and software developments surrounding a novel solenoid-driven clutch-plate actuator, a serpentine manipulator, and visual models enabling autonomous charge-plug insertion for EVs. The solenoid-driven clutch-plate assembly enables low-cost actuation that is both modular and scalable. This actuation method can easily be applied to robots with numerous joints, such as those inspired by spinal (facet) joints and manipulators replicating the function of hands. I use this actuation technique to drive a serpentine manipulator and grip-enabled end-effector to enable autonomous charge-plug insertion.
